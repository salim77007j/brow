## 2026-10-08 · Phase 0 setup · (this commit)

**WHAT.**
- Verified local HEAD == `origin/main` == `7cc97381a` (fresh clone after
  environment reset).
- Created rollback tag `v0.6.1-safe` (= v0.6.1 release state) and pushed it.
- Created working branch `v0.7-rebuild` (owner directive 0.2).
- Archived v0.6.1 real-binary audit evidence into the repo:
  `docs/evidence/v0.6.1-audit/` — released-binary screenshots (toolbar
  invisible / CJK tofu / black raster artifact on wikipedia), engine logs,
  measured single-tab RSS (385 MB example.com, 423 MB wikipedia, software-GL
  VM caveats documented in the README there).
- Wrote the process set: `docs/PROCESS.md` (rules 0.1–0.10 operationalized),
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-001..D-005), `docs/RISKS.md` (R-01..R-12).

**WHY.** Phase 0 = risk reduction before any code: rollback point, branch
isolation, evidence preservation, decision/risk records. Owner rule 1: do not
skip it.

**VERIFIED.** `git rev-parse HEAD` == `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main`;
tag pushed (confirmed by push output); evidence files present in-tree; no
product code touched in this commit.

**Branch protection (owner directive 0.7).** Attempted via GitHub API after
this commit; result recorded in the next WORKLOG entry.
